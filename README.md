**Elemental**
> The movie I watched elemental was good, because I can relate to that movie a lot and Despite being warm and colorful in its visuals and seeming like a kidsâ€™ film at first glance, Elemental does talk about real-world issues and struggles that many youngsters grow up around in this modern day and then at first the effects of the movie are good, like a 3D version, the topic is about family and the relationships that can be formed.
